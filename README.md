#Frvr: Friend-to-Friend Sustainable Fashion Sharing
#üå± Sustainability Track
Frvr is our innovative solution to combat fast fashion waste developed during the Sustainability Track hackathon. We've created a platform that leverages technology to transform how friends share clothing, extending garment lifecycles and reducing textile waste.
#üí° The Problem: Fast Fashion Crisis
The fashion industry is facing a sustainability crisis backed by alarming statistics:

The fashion industry produces 10% of global carbon emissions - more than international flights and maritime shipping combined (UNEP, 2023)
Approximately 92 million tons of textile waste is created annually worldwide, equivalent to a garbage truck full of clothes dumped in a landfill every second (Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2022)
The average consumer today buys 60% more clothing items than 20 years ago, but keeps each garment for only half as long (McKinsey, 2023)
85% of textiles end up in landfills or incinerated, with only 1% truly recycled into new garments (World Economic Forum, 2023)
A single T-shirt requires 2,700 liters of water to produce‚Äîenough for one person to drink for 2.5 years (World Resources Institute, 2022)
College students spend an average of $1,800 annually on fashion items, with 30% worn fewer than three times (Journal of Consumer Research, 2023)

Research shows shared clothing can reduce an individual's fashion carbon footprint by up to 33% (Sustainability Journal, 2023)
The global clothing rental market is projected to reach $2.08 billion by 2025 (Grand View Research, 2023)
73% of Gen Z and millennials are willing to pay more for sustainable products (First Insight, 2022)
Peer-to-peer fashion sharing could extend the average lifecycle of garments by 9 months, reducing carbon, waste, and water footprints by 20-30% per item (Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2022)
College campuses represent $78 billion in purchasing power, with 89% of students indicating they would choose a brand with sustainable practices (Nielsen Global Survey, 2023)
